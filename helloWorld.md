## Hello World

My first coding experience was back when Udacity launched their CS101 course in 2012. I spent part of my summer finishing that and discovering that I enjoyed programming. Ever since, I've been interested in diving deeper but couldn't find the motivation.

## Journey

Last August, I stumbled upon Dev Bootcamp while browsing /r/programming. The idea that I could become a software developer in such a short time period thrilled me, but I was still skeptical and took my time researching bootcamps while learning via online resources.

By the time I settled on Hack Reactor in mid-November, I had already spent a couple months dabbling in Java and Ruby/Rails following tutorials and felt fairly confident in my ability to teach myself anything. My pace up until that point had been slow but steady. I needed a catalyst.

## Friends

I continued to devour online resources and completed my first [app](https://github.com/waieez/nodevshumanity) Christmas Eve. [(demo)](https://nodevshumanity.herokuapp.com)

This gave me the confidence to go to an Angular and Node meetup where I met some really awesome people.

In an alternate reality, I would've spent the rest of my pre-HackReactor days as an intern at Factor75.com. Instead, I'll be attending the February Remote cohort (thanks Allen and HR admissions team!).

## Thanks

To Jimmy Tsao, Mark Moschel, Neel Bhaat, and Joesph Jung:
Thank you so much for the wisdom, patience, and kindness you have shown me.
You guys are fabulous.

To my family:
I'm sorry. I love you all deeply. Thank you for believing in me.

## Metamorphosis

In two days, I join my fellow hackers (remotely) as we undergo the intense three month program that is Hack Reactor. I'll be spending that time locked up in my room hacking away at amazing projects I can't wait to show off.

I don't know if caterpillars dream of becoming beautiful butterflies, but I've been dreaming this dream for a long time now.

It's time to make it a reality.
